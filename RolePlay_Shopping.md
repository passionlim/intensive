[RolePlay] shopping

I bought this smartphone online last year. 
  - But it was not functional. 
  - a lot of scratch on its screen.
  - one of items missed 

I was up set to receive this smart phone that looked used-one

First of all,
I was surprised how such a product was delivered to me.

First of all, I want to exchange this with unused new one. I kind of am tech savvy. I had been very exited at this smartphone until I received this product. I really wanted to use this model because of cutting-edge functions. But I can’t use this smartphone in this status.

If it’s not possible, I want to get a refund for this product.

Can you inform me any way to send this product to you?
