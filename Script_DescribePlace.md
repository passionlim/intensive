[Topic] Describe places

## describe Dongyang Creativity Center.( DYCC )

I’m attending intensive English course in DYCC which is located on the outskirts of Ilsan and Seoul. So I was inaccessible by public transportations. However It’s surrounded by small hills and manufacturings, thus It is a good place for me to concentrate on my study. 

First of all, the building consists of 3 places that are good for study. There are comfortable and cozy dromitories, making it possible to take a rest comfortably. There are many quite classrooms, making it possible to concentrate on my study. There is a cafeteria which offers well balanced foods which help me to stay healty. 

Second of all, there are other convenient facilities that residents can use such as a small gym, a convenience store, a sauna and a pc room. Among them, I usually enjoy a sauna to relieve my stress and a gym to keep my health after dinner.

Lastly, The only thing I’m not satisfied with is a long distance between the classroom and the restroom. It is too long for me to take a enough rest in my 10 minutes break between classes.

In conclusion, even though the building cannot satisfy all residents’ expectations, I’ve been satisfied with facilities in this build. Therefore I strongly recommend this place as your study place.

## Describe the place you live

- location ( mountain / facilities )
- Entertaining in the living room
- Dining table ( berrak obama / family time )
- Comforatble house

I’m living in the apartment which is located in the western Pangyo district on the outskirts of Seoul. I like this town because it’s surrounded by beautiful mountains and it has a lot of convenient neighborhood. 

First of all, the first time you come into my house, you can see the living room in the middle of my apartment, in which my family spends most of our time. There are a couple of bookshelves with many books for my child and comfortable couch on which we can sit while watching TV.

Second of all, the kitchen and the living room are connected and there is a dining table that we enjoy our meals at between them. I like that table. According to Berrak Obama’s saying, having dinner together with his family is as important as his duty as a president.  So I’m trying to have meals with my family on weekends as frequent as possible. I’m pretty sure that it can improve our relationship.

In conclusion, I’m fortunate to stay at such a comfortable house with my family together.

## Q3 Describe the area around your home
- satisfaction with town
- Fancy bars and shop / flee market 
- Facilities ( library / sports centers )
- Expensive

I moved into my apartment 3 years ago. As that point on, I’ve been satisfied with my neighborhood and convenient facilities nearby.

First of all, a certain area in my town is renowned for fancy restaurants and bars. They are actually introduced on some magazines. Sometimes flee markets are voluteerly held by neighbors. Thus on weekends, it is always crowed with visitors from other town.

Second of all, as for convenient facilities for residents, there is a library and a sports center in center of the town. I sometimes go there to read books with my kid and to enjoy swimming together. Behind the library, there is a tall mountain where we usually go on a picnic to make memories.

However, even though my town is great place to live, the real estate price is getting more expansive these days. So I’m worried about my rental contract next year.

Cafe

- Two cafes ( near my house and office )
- Relationship in my family
- Teamwork at work
- Have a time with others. 

I’d like to go to two cafes called “a twosome place” with my family and with my colleages. The one is located near my apartment and the other is located on a basement in my company.

First of all, my wife and I enjoy sipping flavored hot coffe at the cafe while winding down and sitting on the chair on weekends. My kid also likes to go there to taste a sweet piece of cake. We enjoy that time because we can’t have such a time on weekdays because of busy work. It is the good place to improve our relationship.

Second of all, there is an accessible cafe for employees in my company. We also get an additional 10% discount for all menus. Because of its affordable price, I usually go there with my colleagues to have a chat. It is very helpful for our team to know each other and also to improve our teamwork.

In conclusion, I’m really enjoying the time at those cafes. It helps to improve a relationship with others. Therefore I strongly recommend to have a time with your close friends and family at cafes.
