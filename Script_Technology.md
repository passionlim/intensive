- I : convenient / useful smartphones 
- B1 : diverse functions of smartphone  
- B2 : efficient function at work
- C : necessary for my life

I like to use a various kind of electronic devices at home and at work. Among them, smartphones are the most **convenient and helpful devices** for me. Let me give you some reasons.

First of all, I can enjoy various functions of my smartphone whenever I want. I can take high quality photos using my smartphone instead of carrying my heavy digital camera. Also I can watch interesting game videos online. I'm absolutely stuck with **my smartphone at home**.

Plus I can effectively **communicate with my colleagues at work** regardless my location. I can send and read documents using smartphone wherever I am. Therefore to share infomation, I don't have to meet my colleagues face to face. If someone need my opinion, I can just reply messages even at home.

Therefore, I **can’t imagine** I would live without smartphones.

## Tell me about some issues people talk about related to technology. Why is it a problem? How do people deal with this problem.

- I : addiction to cellphone
- B1 :
- B2 :
- C : 

People are stuck with stamtphones all the time. When they walk, when they watch TV, when they lay on the bed, they always spend a time with their smartphones. However, **addiction to cellphones** has become social issues.

First of all, the addiction to the cellphone cause unexpected accidents. Nowadays it’s not easy to find people who are watching phone while they’re walking on the street. It’s very dangerous that it makes people get hurt by cars or bicycles. For this reason, the media has handled these issues several times.

Second of all, offline relationship between people are getting worse because of the addiction. There are people at a restaurant who don’t have a chat with each other sitting at the same table. They just focus on what they’re doing  wherever they are. I’m sure that this cause disconnection between people especially even in a family. Thus some parents prevent their children from using smart phone too much.

In conclusion, I think whole societies should focus on the addictions to decrease these problems.

We all are connected to each other on the Internet. So you can send mesages or pictures you acquaintances very easily. 

Before the Internet come out, it was not easy to send a message to someone who stayed remotely. You could just make a call on the phone. It means that you have to be right there at the phone. 

But As the technology has been progressed, there are many changes to connect without a space

## How has technology evolved over years? Describe how a piece of technology ( and electronic device ) has developed over this years.
 
Ever since technology has been sharply developing, **the way of the people’s communication** has also changed. Definitely, smartphones are the lastest cutting edge devices in the history of communication technology. Let’s try to track the changes of cell phones.

First, **the first generation of mobile phones** was very useful and convenient for people to communicate at that time. For example, in my colleage, I had been carrying around my cellphone everywhere. I could send text messages to my friends and also talk to my friends using cellphone regardless my location.

Since Apple and Samsung released their the state of the art smartphones in the late 2000s, communication between people has became **diverse**. Since smartphones become accessable to the Internet, we can use social media services and instant message services with multimedia such as photos, music, videos.

To sum up, No one knows what devices will **take over smartphones in the future**. Perhaps, it would be possible to communicate through electronic chips in our bodies.
