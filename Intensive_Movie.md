### Describe a movie youâ€™ve seen that really inspired you. What was it about? How did you feel after watching it?

Let me talk about a movie that I watched several years ago. The title is Tunnel in which Ha Jung Woo starred. The story is about people facing a hopless situation and how to overcome it. In the movie, the main actor drives through the tunnel, it sunddenly falls down on him in the middle of the tunnel. He gets stuck in the tunnel without any supplies from outside for serveral days. He trys to survive in hopeless situation. But there are a lot of obstacles outside that prevents him from being rescued. The gervornment just focus on how to be shown on the news or how much it cost rather than how to rescue him. I guess the film trys to reflect a current sociaty in which the money seems more important than a life. 

I was so upset for what goverment do in the movie because there was a sewol ferry accident in those days. Hundreds of people died in the ferry. Facing the accident by gervorment was similar with the one in the movie. 

I agree that these kinds of movies make our society healthier. They make people have a different aspect of problemn in our society.
