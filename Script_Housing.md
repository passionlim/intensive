I'm living in the apartment in Seongnam. I have been living in this apartment since 2015. It is 20 stories high and I'm living on the 16th floor. The apartment have 3 bedrooms and 2 restrooms. 

The first time you come into the house, you can see the shoe shelf and small mirror on your right. I usually look in the mirror everyday to check how I look before leaving home.

And then, you can see the living room in the middle of my house. I love to spend a time in the living room. There are a couch, a tea table and TV for a rest. I recently bought a foot massage machine last holyday season. When I get off work and return home, I take a massage sitting on the couch and also spending a time with cell phone. This is my favorite happiness at home. 

Then you can find a kitchen next to the living room. There are a one big sink in the moddle of kitchen. There are stove and oven for cooking on the right. On the other side, You can see typical living electorics like air fryer, microwave and blender . The major stuff in the kitchen is a dining table between the kitchen and the living room. Our family have meals together on the weekends.

That's all what I wanna say.

### What has changed in your house compared to the past? Tell me about the house or apartment you lived in when you were a child. How was it different from the one you live in now?

I'm afraid that I can't remember the place to live in a child. but I can describe the place where i started my marriage.
7 years ago, I just got married, And I rent a small apartment which is in the Suju of Yongin. Yongin is a city located in the south of Seoul. We didn't have enough money to rent a good apartment, so we chose small and old one.

The apartment was built in 1994, maybe 20 years ago, so it didn't have a parking lots in the basement. So there is no enough space for all people in the apartment. Most cars parked outside of parking lots. So I always had focused on parking not to scratch other cars until being used to parking.

Meanwhile, the apartment where i'm living is newer. So parking lots are enough for all people in the apartments. I have no stress on the parking since moving to this house. 

Overall, I guess a lack of parking lots was a big difficulties for me in the past.

### Tell me about a change you made to your home. What was the change and why did you make that change? How did your home looklike afterwards. Give me all the details.
