## Memorable Experience for recycling

One day I saw an unfamiliar machine at the designated recycling area when I threw out my trash. I had no idea what this machine is used for. 

As becoming aware of its use, I scaned my ID onto the machine. I discarded all kinds of food trash into the machine. It automatically divided and crushed the materials, and calculated the individual disposal fee. Compared to the past, every household had to pay an equal amount periodically, now the disposal fee become individualized.

This is an efficient way to process food waste. Additionally, some can be reused for animal feed and fertilizer.

## what has been changed in recycling compared to the past.

- [ ] Cut down the amount of trash
- [ ] Efficent use of land
- [ ] Easier taxation through waste
- [ ] Improve the local environment
- [ ] Prevent harmful chemical that comes from burning plastics 
- [ ] Undo environment damage to keep Earth greener planet.

When I was young, actually I didnâ€™t recycle much. Most people were not interested in recycling, including my parents. We just dumped all trash into one trash bin. We just recycled a few materials such as glass bottles, newspapers and boxes.

However, people have begun to pay attention to recycling because of difficulty of handling trash. There was not enough land to dispose trash that was closer to city and nobody wanted to have such new trash disposal site near their neighborhood. To reduce the amount of trash,  the government implemented policies to encourage people to recycle materials from their lives. Korean people have complied with the policy well. Now recycling in Korea has become the most successful role model of recycling around the world.
