## Tell me about the hotels in your country. Where are they usually located? Do they have any special characteristics that are unique to your country? Give as many details as possbiel.

- Intro : Korean guesthouse
- B1 : traditional door / humidity / preventing cold air
- B2 : roof function / preventing hot air
- Concl : nature-friendly 

Most hotels in Korea are built in western-style these days. However, in certain area such as 전주, we can experience Korean style guesthouses.

First of all, Korean style buildings feature special korean traditional doors which are made of wood and paper. They had seemed useless for a long time, however scientists figured out that they help to control humidity in the room as well as to effectively prevent cold air from entering. 

Second of all, another characteristic that sets this type of accommodations from others is the roof of buildings. The roof looks curve-shaped and consists of mud tiles heated in high temperature. The tiles keep the building from heating too much in the summer.

In conclusion, I’m fortunate to experience such a nature-friendly accomodation in South Korea.

##  Memorable experience while staying at a hotel

- Intro : Guam trip as first overseas trip
- Body1: old fashioned and disgusting smell
- Body2: such a fatistic view 
- Body3: great amenities / satisfying breakfast 
- Conclusion : memorable trip with a family

I married my wife in 2010. However after then, I had never visited any travel spot overseas before our first trip to Guam in 2016. 

I can remember I reserved a relatively expensive room at the HYYAT hotel in Guam. However, the first time I got into a hotel room, I was shocked because the room looked very old-fashioned and smelt disgusting. My first impression on the hotel was such a dissatisfaction.

To refresh the air in the room, I opened the window. And I was astonished because the beautiful scenery of the ocean came into my eyes. Consequently, I could feel better.

In addition, the hotel offered me satisfying breakfast without an additional charge. And most amenities such as pool and gym were included in the room. It goes without saying that I enjoyed my time using those facilities to the fullest. 

To wrap it up , It was our great first trip overseas all family together. I learned not to judge a book by its cover.
