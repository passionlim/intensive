I have been living in the apartment since 2015. There were 20 stories in the apartment and I'm living on the 16th floor. The apartment have 3 bedrooms and 2 toilets. 

When you get into the house, you can see the shoe shelf and small mirror on the right. I usually look in the mirror to check how I look everyday before leaving.

And then, you can see the living room in the middle of my house. I love to spend a time in the living room. There are a couch, a tea table for a rest. and I bought a foot massage machine for relaxing last holyday season. I take a massage after a work everyday sitting on the couch and also spend a time with cell phone. this is my usual happiness these days. 

And then, You will find a kitchen next to the living room. There are a one big sink in the center. And gas stove and oven for cooking are on the right. And I place living electorics like air fryer, microwave and blender in the corner of the kitchen. There is a dining table between the kitchen and living room, and our family have meals together at the dining table. 

That's all what I can say.
