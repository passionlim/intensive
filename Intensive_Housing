I have been living in the apartments since 2015. There were 20 stories in the apartment and I'm living on the 16th floor. The apartment have 3 bedrooms and 2 toilets. 

When you get into the house, you can see the shoe shelf and small mirror on the right. I usually look in the mirror to check how I look everyday before leaving.

And then, you can see the living room in the middle of my house. I love to spend a time in the living room. There are a couch, a tea table for a rest. and you can see the foot massage machine for relaxing. I bought the machine in this Thanks Giving Season. Like other people's house, TV stands on the TVㄷㅏㅇㅣ.

In the laundary room , you can see washing machine and refrigator. y
