# [Topic] Gathering

## Compare the past gathering culture to modern gathering culture. What has changed?

Eva, you seem interested in our holiday. I’ll give you a description about the changes of our holidays. Let me give you some details. Please focus on my explanation.

In the past, people got together to celebrate the holidays, especially on Lunar New Year and Korean Thanksgiving holiday. They spent a couple of days to enjoy entertainment together like traditional card games with their relatives, and also we cooked plenty of dishes to share together. They also performed ancestral rites to pay respects to their ancestors. 

However, recently people’s notion about tradition has changed since they have taken care of themselves. Let me give you an example. During the last Thanksgiving holiday, hundreds of thousand of people had a trip abroad. Inchon Internationally oAirport was so crowded with travelers. We have repeatedly faced the news about the increase of travelers abroad every year. Their own lives or their leisure time is becoming more important than preserving their tradition.

## Memorable incident during a holyday

There were 9 days off on thanks giving holiday this year. But I had no specific or special plan during the holiday. Our family was supposed to visit our parents’  houses for 3 days.

However my daughter was not satisfied with staying at home for a whole day. So we decided to have a bicycle trip all together. She just learned how to ride a bicycle and she became interested in it at that time. I packed some food and beverages into my backpack for the trip, then we left for the destination, the riverside park nearby my house. It took us 1 hour to get there. I wonder if It would be difficult for her, but she looked very excited. My wife and I were surprised how well our kid rode a bicycle. We were so proud of her. The first bicycle trip of our family would be one of the most memorable trips of our lives.
