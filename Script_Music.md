### You indicated in the survey that you like listening to music. Can you tell me what kind of music you like? And who is your favorite musician? Why do you like him or her?

I like to listen to various kinds of music. Depending on my feelings and moods, I listen to different genres of music. But I prefer to listen to ballad music more frequently among them. Lee Seung Hwan is one of the most famous ballad singers in Korea. Let me intorduce him.

I'm a big fan of Lee Seung Hwan. He is a historic singer in South Korea. He made his debut in the late 1980s and he's still active with his music. He has a lot of fans who have spent their time along his music history. Including myself, they have spent their youth with his songs. Listening to his songs makes us reminisce our youth.

In addition, He is still a creative and energetic artist. He wrote hundreds of songs and produced dozens of albums. But he still has held serveral concerts anually and also has released his albums every year. Most fans crave attending his concerts. Thererfore, tickets for his concerts have always been sold out in a minute.

After I love his songs and his passionate performances, I've become to admire him. I'm pretty sure that I'll listen to his music 10 year later.

### How did you first get interested in music? What kind of music did you listen to when you were young? How was that music different from the music you listen to today? How has your interest in music changed over the years?

In my 20s, I was a fan of rap music. Looking back, students went to a karaoke with their friends for playing. At that time, rap music began to be listed on the music chart.Actually, I’ve practiced famous raps to stand out from my friends in a karaoke. I downloaded famous raps and memorize all lyrics. After then, I became interested in rap music.

But now, I like to listen to musical music. Since I can afford attending to musicals,  my music taste has been changed to musical music. Compared to the rap music, musical music help me fascinated and passionate for my life because I can reminisce the feeling of musical. I’m still listening my favorite musical song “Impossible Dream” using my smartphone every day.

In my case, I have no idea what music has affect on me, but I can sure I’ve changed my music taste depending on my situations.

### Tell me about a time when you went to listen to some live music. Perhaps it was at a concert or live café. What was the mood like?How did you like the music you listen to there? 

There are many parks in 성남 city where i live. There is a big concert hall in the cetral park. the city held a concert of Old Korea Pop several years ago.

There were may guests such as POSITION and 박혜경 who were pop stars in 1990s. They sang servral their hit songs, people were getting exited in the concert.

The main guest was 김건모, he is still a big star in Korea on the TV show. After he showed up, people stood up and sang along his songs as they were young. The atmosphere of the concert gradually rose and he sang a couple of additional song then the show finished.
