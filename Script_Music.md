### You indicated in the survey that you like listening to music. Can you tell me what kind of music you like? And who is your favorite musician? Why do you like him or her?

I like to listen to various kinds of music. Depending on my feelings and moods, I listen to different genres of music. But I prefer to listen to ballad music more frequently among them. Lee Seung Hwan is one of the most famous ballad singers in Korea. Let me intorduce him.

I'm a big fan of Lee Seung Hwan. He is a historic singer in South Korea. He made his debut in the late 1980s and he's still active with his music. He has a lot of fans who have spent their time along his music history. Including myself, they have spent their youth with his songs. Listening to his songs makes us reminisce our youth.

In addition, He is still a creative and energetic artist. He wrote hundreds of songs and produced dozens of albums. But he still has held serveral concerts anually and also has released his albums every year. Most fans crave attending his concerts. Thererfore, tickets for his concerts have always been sold out in a minute.

After I love his songs and his passionate performances, I've become to admire him. I'm pretty sure that I'll listen to his music 10 year later.

### How did you first get interested in music? What kind of music did you listen to when you were young? How was that music different from the music you listen to today? How has your interest in music changed over the years?

In my 20s, I was a fan of **rap music**. Looking back, students went to a karaoke with their friends for fun. At that time, rap music began to be listed on music charts. Actually, I had practiced famous raps to stand out from my friends in a karaoke. I downloaded famous raps and memorized all lyrics. After then, I became interested in rap music.

But now, I like to listen to **musicals**. Since I can afford attending musicals, my music taste has changed to musicals. Compared to the rap music, it help me fascinated and passionate for my life because the stories of musicals reflect our lives. I’m still listening my favorite musical song “Impossible Dream” every day.

To sum up, I have no idea how music has affected me, but I can be sure I’ve changed my music taste **depending on my situations**.

### Tell me about a time when you went to listen to some live music. Perhaps it was at a concert or live café. What was the mood like?How did you like the music you listen to there? 

There are many parks in 성남 city where i live. There is a big concert hall in the cetral park. the city held a concert of Old Korea Pop several years ago.

There were may guests such as POSITION and 박혜경 who were pop stars in 1990s. They sang servral their hit songs, people were getting exited in the concert.

The main guest was 김건모, he is still a big star in Korea on the TV show. After he showed up, people stood up and sang along his songs as they were young. The atmosphere of the concert gradually rose and he sang a couple of additional song then the show finished.

I and my wife had a really great time to recall our youth. this is about my recent expeirence for live music.

### Which device do people like to listen to music on? Why do people prefer it? please explain.

When it comes to our favorite music electronic devices, most people prefer using their **smartphones** to listen to music. There are some reasons why people do so. Let me introduce them.

First of all, smartphones are **all-in-1 devices**. Before smartphones came into our lives, there were various electronic gadgets for listening to music like mp3 players and cd players. But those players are specialized for listening to music. Smartphones are multi-funcational. We don’t need to carry any other device.

Second of all, we can listen to music in a **more convenient way**. Because we can access the internet using smartphones, we can download music on our devices or play music on demand by streaming.

To sum up, I can’t imagine not using smartphone when listening to music because they have convenient and useful functions. However, due to their **multi-functionality**, you’d be bothered by other application installed on your phone. If you really want to concentrate on listening to music, you’d better switch your startphone to airplane mode.
