## Tell about a time when someone was angry with you. 

- Argument beween married couple.
- My wife’s sudden anger
- Try to reconcile with wife
- Resolve misunderstaing later

Ever since I got married to my wife, we’ve argued on various topics such as what to cook for dinner and whether to purchase some products. Most arguments were caused by misunderstanding. Let me talk about my experience  about our misunderstanding.

One day, it was a peaceful weekend in my house. I was surfing the Internet and my wife was washing dishes. Our daughter also played with toys in the living room as usual. It seemed a normal weekend routine. Suddenly my wife yelled at me about why I didn’t help her with our house chores. I didn’t notice my wife getting stressed out from doing house chores. 

After all, to prevent the argument from getting worse, I went out to throw out  garbage and to recycle materials. And then I tried to talk about why she was upset. She complaint that she seemed to be the only person who had done house chores. Actually, we didn’t decide how to divide our chores. Even though I did the house chores several times by myself, I didn’t want the argument more serious. I expressed my sorry for her and tried to reconcile with my wife. 

some days later, I told my wife how to take care of house chores without argument. I promised I would volunteerly help her with our house chores and ask her not to yell at me but to let me know if she wants to help. I learned from this experience that it is impossible to prevent misunderstanding in advance, but it is possible to resolve misunderstanding later.

Intensive course

I attended intensive english course 4 weeks ago. The course developed a reputation for a well-organized process and competence teachers, in contrast to the other language courses in CJ. 

Staffs in the course made ground rules during our retreat, such as EOP,  prohibiting drinking alcohol and no cellphone, to help participants focus on their study. Especially drinking alcohol was strictly prohibited because it was able to put participants at a major disadvantage in terms of their condition and  safety.

Though this course, I expected to be the beneficiary of this course as I would go on a business trip. From the first week, I studied hard at all hours of the day and night to spend my valuable time.  However, as time passed, I had been worried about my improvement. So I talked to my instructor in person to obtain his advice. 

Even though he spent more time than he had intended on, I was not able to break though my limit yet. However I’ve necessarily trust his feedback that I’ve been improving.


- 실력있는 : competence
