Favorite Cafe 

My Favorite Cafe... Oh. Let me introduce A twosome place that is a franchise in South Korea.

First, A Twosome place is run by CJ. As I introduced myself, I’m working for CJ, so I can get various kind of benefits from the company. All employees working for CJ can get a 40% discount for everything on the menu. Plus I can get an additional 10% off from the cafe in my office. I can buy a black coffee at about a half price cheaper than the other cafe. 

In the taste of coffee, I really like to drink black coffee, especially strong ones. The coffee in a Twosome place matches my taste. The taste is enough strong to be awaken in the morning. When I come to the office in the morning, I often go there before starting to work.

In conclusion, a big discount and satisfying taste lead me to A twosome place cafe when i want coffee.

I usually go to cafes with my colleagues after lunch. We work hard in the office in the morning. After lunch, we need to be relaxed and to communicate to each other. I think cafes are the right place.

We are human beings, different from machines. Each of us has an interest according to our own situations. As we have a time together, they can know the others’ interest very well. Each of members are familiar with the others through the informal meeting. I like this meeting because it makes our team work more harmoniously.

Sometimes brilliant ideas come out of the meeting at cafes. Someone mention about a problem who are facing, then the other suggests the solution for that. We get better ideas in informal environments compared to when we are in formal environments in the conference room. 

In conclusion, meeting at a cafe is often useful to resolve the problem in our work.

Thesedays there are a lot of cafes in cities, even you can easily find cafes at a rural area. Many people have gotten into coffee in South Korea. I read on the news that South Korea is one of the biggest market for coffee.

Looking back 20 years, coffee was only for the people who really enjoyed or who needed a place to meet to talk. If you had a blind date at that time, it was a general place where you would make an appointment with a partner.

Meanwhile, people go to cafes more frequently. Most of them just like to drink coffee after meals like a dessert. It’s because they can be affordable to buy the drinks every day, and also the price have been more inexpensive as time goes on.

In addition, There are a lot of cafes only for to-go. They sell beverages in cheaper price compared to cafes that have seats. For the busy workers, that’s the economical choice to buy coffee.

Let’s warp it up. I think cafes has changed a lot depending on people’s thoughts about coffee and their financial wealth.
