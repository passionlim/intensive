## Where is your favorite cafe? what drinks do you like to drink there? why do you like to go there?

When it comes to my favorite cafe, there are two kind of cafes where I usually go. The one is located near my house, and the other is located in my office. Both are franchise cafes run by CJ. Let me introduce why I go there.

First of all, I usually go there because I can enjoy beverages and desserts at a discounted price. As a employee working for CJ, I can get a discount up to 40% for all kinds of foods. The price is very competitive compared to the one else where. 

Second of all, I usuallay order a cup of black coffe because the coffee flavor matches my taste. and I sometimes purchase  sweet cakes whose tastes are hamonious with coffee. Moreover when I'm fed up with coffee, I usually drink a cup of tea called cream caramel.

Third of all, those cafes are very accessable from where I live and where I work. I don't like traveling for cafes to enjoy coffee and desert.  

To sum it up, I'm fortunate to have such economical and fancy cafes near my work and home.

I usually go to cafes with my colleagues after lunch. We work hard in the office in the morning. After lunch, we need to be relaxed and to communicate to each other. I think cafes are the right place.

We are human beings, different from machines. Each of us has an interest according to our own situations. As we have a time together, they can know the others’ interest very well. Each of members are familiar with the others through the informal meeting. I like this meeting because it makes our team work more harmoniously.

Sometimes brilliant ideas come out of the meeting at cafes. Someone mention about a problem who are facing, then the other suggests the solution for that. We get better ideas in informal environments compared to when we are in formal environments in the conference room. 

In conclusion, meeting at a cafe is often useful to resolve the problem in our work.

Thesedays there are a lot of cafes in cities, even you can easily find cafes at a rural area. Many people have gotten into coffee in South Korea. I read on the news that South Korea is one of the biggest market for coffee.

Looking back 20 years, coffee was only for the people who really enjoyed or who needed a place to meet to talk. If you had a blind date at that time, it was a general place where you would make an appointment with a partner.

Meanwhile, people go to cafes more frequently. Most of them just like to drink coffee after meals like a dessert. It’s because they can be affordable to buy the drinks every day, and also the price have been more inexpensive as time goes on.

In addition, There are a lot of cafes only for to-go. They sell beverages in cheaper price compared to cafes that have seats. For the busy workers, that’s the economical choice to buy coffee.

Let’s warp it up. I think cafes has changed a lot depending on people’s thoughts about coffee and their financial wealth.
