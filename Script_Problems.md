I’m working as IT engineer in my company. My team are in charge of operating and maintaining commerce systems as stable as possible. My company is a home shopping broadcasting company as well as an e-commerce company. 

Most customers have visited our website to purchase products. Plus most employees use the systems to manage products’ details such as stock quantity and product details. Therefore if our system become unstable, It can directly affect our sales and profits. 

Since joining my company, I’ve experienced system instability several times. It’s very stressful for me to keep my own life comfortable because we don’t know when problems would happen and how serious they are. 

Thus we’ve developed some monitoring systems that notify system problems to system managers. From that point on we can solve problems in advance before they are serious. 

Finally I can get back my normal life at home and now I don’t need to worry too much. 

Q1b
## Have you had any problems in your home? What was the problem, and how did you deal with it?

Background : rent / permission
Cause+Problem : air conditioner broken
Solution : service center
Conclusion : less expensive

I’m living in an apartment for rent. When I need to fix a problem in my house, especially needed expansive costs, sometimes I need to ask a permission for fixation to my house owner.

Last summer it was very hot to stay without air conditioners. It goes without saying that I had left air conditioners on all day. One day one of air conditioners     suddenly became out-of-order. Even though I could spent the rest of the summer with the single working one, I want the broken one to be fixed for cooler summer. 

I called a service center to request a repair of the broken air conditioner. Some days later, service engineers visited my house and diagnosed it for a while and then fixed it in a twinkle of an eye.

They charged $100 for a repair. It was less expensive than exhausted summer life.
