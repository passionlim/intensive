- Intro (2) : nearest park
- Body1(2) : watch children playing
- Body2(2) : catch bugs 
- Body3(2) : watch my smartphones 
- Conclusion(2) : 

I really enjoy going to the park next to my apartment. I have a little daughter who wants to go the park whenever I can.

What I mainly do is taking care of my daughter and playing with her in the park.  There are many children from my town and so they usually play together. It helps us to have fun and to strength our relationship between a father and a daughter. 

If my daughter is not playing with her friends, then she’s most likely catching bugs near the park. There are paths to the mountain next to the park. My daughter doesn’t have fear to touch bugs yet. I just look after her not getting hurt.

I don’t mind playing with my daughter, but I also like to watch my smartphone while sitting on the bench. It’s always possible to have fun with smartphones until my daughter call me. 

I’m really fortunate to have such an exiting park to have fun with my family near my house. 

## Tell me why you started to take walks in the first place

- Intro (2) : unfamiliar location
- Body1(2) : familiar neighborhoods.
- Body2(2) : work out
- Body3(2) : relieve stress
- Conclusion(2) : pleasure to

When I moved into the town that I’m living in 3 years ago. I was unfamiliar with  neighborhoods nearby at that time.

One day, I went out with my daughter to looking around my neighborhoods. I found the park having a road along a narrow creek 5 minutes away from home. There were some people to enjoy jogging and riding their bicycles along the road. After I watched they were working out, I suddenly felt guility for being obese and lazy at that time. After taking a walk for a while, I figured that walking in the park and breathing fresh air were helpful for me to relieve my stress.

From that point on, I started going to the park more often. I’m really fortunate to have such a good park within walking distance nearby.
