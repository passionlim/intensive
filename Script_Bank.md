## Have you ever experienced any problems at a bank? What problems did you face and how did you deal with it?

- Intro/background : smartphones/ wrong PIN / locked
- Body : unlock ( number/ID/bankbook/review)
- Conclusion : careful / KAKAO 

One day, I was using a online banking application on my smartphone. When I sent some money to my friend online, I accidentally entered wrong pin # several times, which caused it to lock my account. So I had to go to the bank to unlock my account.

As soon as i got into the bank, I got a number. Within minutes, it was my turn. The teller requested my ID and my bank book in order to start the unlocking process. Upon review, she gave me the green light. After that, I let out a sigh of relief. 

I learned from the experience that I should be careful when I use online bank applications. I also consider to change my favorite banking service to KAKAO bank app that is more convenient and simpler.

## I’m going to describe a situation for you to act out. You were visiting an ATM machine when suddenly the machine ate your card. Please call an agent and describe the situation.

Intro / Background 
B1 : card back 
B2 : cash at hand / any alternatives

Hello. Is that a security agent that is in charge of ATM at ABC Bank.
I’m calling you because I have a problem when using your ATM at Seoul cityhall. The ATM ate my card. I was trying to withdraw some cash from your ATM. I entered wrong PIN # several times by mistake, which caused it to eat my card. 

I’m wondering if I can get my card back in the ATM. 

< I’m afraid that it’s not possible right now. You have to visit the bank beside  you tomorrow to get a new card reissued . >

That’s a big problem for me because I need some cash at hand. Could you give me any alternatives for this problem?

< Sorry, sir. I’m afraid there is nothing I can help you. >

Ok.. I have to look for an another way. 
Thank you for your prompt response.
