I have been living in the apartment since 2015. There were 20 stories in the apartment and I'm living on the 16th floor. The apartment have 3 bedrooms and 2 toilets. 

When you get into the house, you can see the shoe shelf and small mirror on the right. I usually look in the mirror to check how I look everyday before leaving.

And then, you can see the living room in the middle of my house. I love to spend a time in the living room. There are a couch, a tea table for a rest. and I bought a foot massage machine for relaxing last holyday season. I take a massage after a work everyday sitting on the couch and also spend a time with cell phone. this is my usual happiness these days. 

And then, You will find a kitchen next to the living room. There are a one big sink in the center. And gas stove and oven for cooking are on the right. And I place living electorics like air fryer, microwave and blender in the corner of the kitchen. There is a dining table between the kitchen and living room, and our family have meals together at the dining table. 

That's all what I can say.

### What has changed in your house compared to the past? Tell me about the house or apartment you lived in when you were a child. How was it different from the one you live in now?

I'm afraid that I can't remember the place to live in a child. but I can describe the place where i started my marriage.
7 years ago, I just got married, And I rent a small apartment which is in the Suju of Yongin. Yongin is a city located in the south of Seoul. We didn't have enough money to rent a good apartment, so we chose small and old one.

The apartment was built in 1994, maybe 20 years ago, so it didn't have a parking lots in the basement. So there is no enough space for all people in the apartment. Most cars parked outside of parking lots. So I always had focused on parking not to scratch other cars until being used to parking.

Meanwhile, the apartment where i'm living is newer. So parking lots are enough for all people in the apartments. I have no stress on the parking since moving to this house. 

Overall, I guess a lack of parking lots was a big difficulties for me in the past.

### Tell me about a change you made to your home. What was the change and why did you make that change? How did your home looklike afterwards. Give me all the details.
