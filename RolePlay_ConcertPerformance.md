# RolePlay Concert & Perfomance

## What kind of concerts of performances do you like to see?

My favorite performance is musical. I’ve watched musicals a couple of times since 2008. As I watched my first musical “The man of la mancha.”, I have become a big fan of musicals. I was very impressed on live music and emotional acting in musicals. 

Music in musicals is definitely sung and performed lively. Compared to the recording music in studios, live music enables people to feel more impressive on musicals because the actors and audiences listen and feel together at the same place. And also we can see actor’s faces while they’re acting. So we can feel their emotional atmosphere from their acting right there. 

Watching musicals is very fascinating and touching. If you have no experience on musicals, I strongly recommend you would do. As my first experience was so fantastic, so I frequently listen to the music of “Man of lamanch” to reminisce the memorable feelings of musicals.


## Most recent concert you’ve been to. Which concert was it? Where was it held? Who did you go with? Was there anything particularly memorable about it? Please describe it in detail.

I was an amateur for musicals before my first musical experience. Few years ago, I had to spend my remaining points on the musical website because the points were supposed to be expiring soon. I decided to spend most of the points to buy musical tickets called “The man of la mancha” to enjoy with my wife. The reason why I chose that musical was that it was the most famous musical at that time.

The musical was so fascinating to me due to the leading actor’s voice. The musical starred JeongSungHwa as a Don Quixote. He was a former-comedian but had been becoming a famous musical actor. His voice was so emotional and strong that all audiences were focusing on his voice and his performance. 

The story of the musical is about the old aged knight being delusional but being enthusiastic for his dream. At that time, I was losing my confidence because of problems at my work. I asked to myself “what am I doing right? What should i do in my future?” After listening the theme song, “The impossible dream.” , at last, I could convince that worring too much is useless. The song help me to be passionate, brave and confident to overcome my difficulties.

These days when i get in a touble, I sometimes listen to the theme song to relieve my anxiety.
