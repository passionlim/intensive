# RolePlay Concert & Perfomance

## What kind of concerts or performances do you like to see?

musticals are my favorite performance. I’ve watched musicals a couple of times since 2008. After I watched my first musical “The man of la mancha.”, I have become a big fan of musicals. I was very impressed with live music and emotional performance in musicals. 

Live musics are more impressive among any kind of musics. Compared to the recording music in studios, live music enables people to feel more impressive with musicals because the actors and audiences are in harmony at the same place. And also we can see actor’s faces while they’re acting. So we can feel their emotional vibe from their acting right there. 

Watching musicals is very fascinating and touching. If you have no experience on musicals, I strongly recommend you try that. Because my first experience was so fantastic, so I frequently listen to the music of “Man of lamanch” to reminisce the memory of musicals.


## Most recent concert you’ve been to. Which concert was it? Where was it held? Who did you go with? Was there anything particularly memorable about it? Please describe it in detail.

I was an amateur for musicals before my first musical experience. Few years ago, I had my remaining points on the musical website. So I purchased musical tickets with the points to enjoy with my wife. The name of the musical was “The man of la mancha." The reason why I chose that musical was that it was the most famous musical at that time.

The musical was so fascinating to me because of the leading actor’s voice. The musical starred JeongSungHwa as a Don Quixote. He was a former-comedian but had been becoming a famous musical actor at that time. His voice was so emotional and strong that all audiences were focusing on his voice and his performance. 

The story of the musical is about the old aged knight being delusional but being enthusiastic for his dream. At that time, I was losing my confidence because of problems at work. But after listening the theme song, “The impossible dream.” , at last, I was convinced that worring too much is useless. The song helped me to be passionate, brave and confident to overcome my difficulties. Recently when i get in a touble, I sometimes listen to the theme song to relieve my anxiety.
