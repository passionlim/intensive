## story in which setenses contain whose/whom/where. story in which setenses contain for/since

My wife and I couldn’t see each other **for 5 days** last week due to my language intensive course. I was exhausted after the 3rd week of the course, so I wanted to take a rest at home last weekend, but we had some plans to go out.

We had a reservation to see a doctor **whom** we met several weeks ago for my daughter’s tooth treatment. We were heading to the dental clinic **where** my daughter was afraid to go **since our last visit**. At that time, my daughter was supposed to receive treatment, called Sealant, for her 4 back teeth to prevent them from cavities. But she just got the one teeth done because of her fear for the sound of the dental machine. Several nurses tried to persuade my daughter **whose** first impression on dental clinics was full of fear. But they failed to persuaded and we had to reschedule it. After all, we visited the clinic again and wished my daughter made it well at this time. I had stood beside her by encouraging her **since** the doctor started to treat the rest of her teeth. During the treatment, she told us her discomfort, but she endured it as well. Thankfully, we was able to finish the treatment.
