Body1: commuting transportation / bus directly
Body2: intercity bus / downtwn
Conclusion : bus convenient

There are various transportation systems in Seoul. For example, there are bus systems throughout the country, and several cities have great subway systems. Among them,I prefer taking a bus when i commute or when i go to downtown.

First of all, when I moved into my house located in a rural city, I found a bus that pass by my office. It is the fastest transportation to get there. I donâ€™t like to waste my time in the morning to wait other transportations. From that point on, I have frequently taken the bus when i commute.

Second of all, Korean bus system cover a larger geographical area outside of Seoul. There are lots of bus routes between cities and those intercity buses run frequently. It is very convenient for me to go to downtown outside of Seoul. 

In conclusion, buses are still the more convenient transportation for people living in rural area.
