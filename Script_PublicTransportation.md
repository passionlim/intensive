- Conclusion : bus convenient

There are various transportation systems in Seoul. For example, there are bus systems throughout the country, and several cities have great subway systems. Among them, I prefer taking a bus when i commute or when i go to downtown.

First of all, when I moved into my house located in a rural city, I found a bus that passes by my office. It is the fastest transportation to get there. It was uncomfortable because it shook a lot. But I donâ€™t like to waste my time in the morning to wait other transportations. From that point on, I have frequently taken the bus when I commute.

Second of all, Korean bus system cover a larger geographical area outside of Seoul. There are lots of bus routes between cities and intercity buses to run frequently. It is very convenient and comfortable for me to go to downtown.

In conclusion, like my experience, buses are still a convenient transportation for people living in rural area.

## How has the public transportation system changed over time? What are the differences between the types of transportation you used as a child and the types you use today? Provide as many details as possible.

I'm happy to introduce the changes in public transportation system in South Korea. There were big changes in public transportation system in the 2000s in South Korea. Let me introduce them.

First of all, there were only 4 subway lines in Seoul. They were not inconvenient because they didn't cover a large geographical area at that time. But now, there are over 10 subway lines spread throughout Seoul, making it possible to easily get anywhere. The millions of people in Korea have been commuting by the subway every day.

Second of all, there were not convenient facilities in subway stations such as elevators, escalators. It was inaccessible for the disabled to use the subway. However now, Korea government has heavily invested in the subway system, make the subway efficient for the disabled. We even have designated seats for the pregnant.

In conclusion, I'm very proud of having such great public transportation systems in our country.

## You may have had a time when you faced an uncomfortable situation while using the subway or bus. Can you tell me about that experience? When did it occur? How did you handle the situation?

I remember a uncomfortable experience in the subway. One day I took a subway while on my way home. It was crowed by many passengers. Someone got on the subway and started to sell something while yelling about his product. It was too hard for me to stand to listening to his yelling because I had to take the subway for a long time. So I got off the subway and waited for the next. It was not crowed on the next subway and I could have comfortable time on the rest of my way home.

I learned from the experience that it's better to walk away than to stand a uncomfortable situation.
