- Intro: my commuting
- Body1: commuting transportation / bus directly
- Body2: intercity bus / downtwn
- Conclusion : bus convenient

There are various transportation systems in Seoul. For example, there are bus systems throughout the country, and several cities have great subway systems. Among them, I prefer taking a bus when i commute or when i go to downtown.

First of all, when I moved into my house located in a rural city, I found a bus that passes by my office. It is the fastest transportation to get there. It was not unconfortable because It shaked a lot. But I donâ€™t like to waste my time in the morning to wait other transportations. From that point on, I have frequently taken the bus when I commute.

Second of all, Korean bus system cover a larger geographical area outside of Seoul. There are lots of bus routes between cities and those intercity buses run frequently. It is very convenient and confortable for me to go to downtown.

In conclusion, like my experience, buses are still a convenient transportation for people living in rural area.
