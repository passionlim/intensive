## What are the things you usually shop for? What do you consider before going shopping.

- Intro: shopping pattern / online offlie
- Body1: offline - geroceris and foods
- Body2: online - the others
- Conclusion: finally online

According to my shopping pattern, I have two kinds of shopping patterns: offline vs online.

When I purchase fresh foods, I usually go to the mart near my apartment. I have experiences that I’ve purchased some vegetables online at emart mall. However I was not satisfied with the freshness of veggies. After that, I go to the mart to buy vegetables and groceries while checking their freshness. 

Except for fresh foods or some groceries that I can buy in the mart, I usually shop online. I search for products on the Internet, and I try to compare their prices. Before I purchase, I also check out product reviews that other customers post. Reading reviews helps me to make an informed decision. 

To sum up, I consider to buy fresh foods when shopping offline. Except for that, I usually shop online while considering the product price and reviews.

## Please tell me about an item you recently bought. When was it, and where did you buy that item? Were you satisfied with the item you bought?

- Intro/background :  intensive cource / lack of humitity
- B1: online search / economical price / long operation time
- Concluation : satisfaction

When I attended a english intensive course, I left my house and was supposed to stayed at ABC traning center for 6 weeks. I’ve been almost satisfied with facilities in the building. However It was too hard to sleep deeply in my dorm room because of lack of humidity in the room.

After the first week passed, on that weekend I tried to look for some humidifiers that I can use for rest 5 weeks. I searched some candidates on CJmall website. I chose the one because I can buy it at reasonable price and it had sufficient size to run all night.

Since the 2nd week, I’ve turned on the humidifier while staying in my room. It helped me and my roommate to sleep deeply at night. So we could get better condition.
