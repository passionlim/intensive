When it comes to my future career, my goal is to become an irreplaceable tech expert in the IT industry. To archive it, Iâ€™m trying to do 2 things: studying tech trends and improving English.

First of all, I must try to understand technology trends in the IT. Since the technology in the IT has been developing dramatically, it has become more difficult to totally know all technology trends. So I have to spend much time to read technical articles on the Internet and to practice new skills more efficiently.

Second of all, most articles regarding new technology are written in English earlier than in other languages. And also most conferences that introduce new tech trends are usually held in English-speaking countries, especially in silicon valley, the US. Thus I have to improve English ability to learn tech skills more effectively. 

To sum it up, even though it is hard to focus on all changes in the IT, I have to keep studying a lot to remain as an expert. It goes without saying that it makes me to become an irreplaceable person in the IT.
