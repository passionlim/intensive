Since the 1990s, The computer industry has drastically changed in our lives. Let me introduce their changes according my experience.

First of all, online services make an effect on how to consume multimedia contents with computers. In my middle schools, I used to use computers when I wrote documents or played computer games by myself. However nowadays, since the internet came into our lives, we’ve enjoy various kinds of entertainment contents online, such as videos and games. 

Second of all, there have been changes in computer devices. I can remember a computer which my parents bought me when I was 10. It was too big to lay on my desk and it was noisy when it worked. It had 2 disk drives where I put diskettes to play games. But now most computers are very small and thin, and  they don’t have any noisy disk drives. DVD/CD drives have also disappeared in computers. The only place where you can see diskettes is the icon on the save button on your office program.

In conclusion, in our future, the present look of computers would become various in our future. I can observe the change with TVs, cellphones and smart watchs now.

- Success end of project

Our company had faced problems in our infra system for several years because of a lack of investment. When user’s traffic went up to ㅁ peak, our systems went down every day. To solve this, the IT division in our company had to consider a new project to refine our system. Finally the renewal project started from last year.

In that project, I was put in charge of developing programs for some parts of our system and deciding an architecture for our new system. Because the system was too out-of-date, there were so many points to modify. Thus I analyzed the trends and issues for our new system as well as reached out to our business experts who could suggest solutions.

During the project, even though everyone in our division was determined to put their effort into the project, we faced a lack of human resources. To reduce the risk, we recruited some engineers and made contracts with expertise companies that can cover other parts of our system. Fortunately, everything went according to plan.

After all, we successfully finished our project on time. After I watched the system runing without any problems, I let out a sigh of relief. The most important lesson that I learned from the project is that hard work pays off.
