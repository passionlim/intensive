If I had a $500 budget for a person, I would like to go to Osaka in Japan again. Especially this time, I'd like to go on a vacation with 3 of my family. 

First of all, I could get the cheapest ticket for a round trip flight at $100 per a person if I left on week days or I gained early bird bargins. However, I have to do a lot of research for flight promotions.

Second of all, I'd like to reserve the most luxurious rooms during the vacation within $350 per a day. My company supports an attractive welfare for overseas hotels. Thus I just have to pay $60 a day. Everything else is covered by the company's welfare.

Third of all, I'm still having a half of the budget, $740. In fact, I'm not quite interested in trourist places. I'd like to enjoy local foods when I visit foreign countries. Osaka, adjecant to the sea, is renouwed for its local delicacies, such as Takoyaki, ramen, and sushi. I would spend most budgets to enjoy those foods. 

To sum it up, after the trip we must work out harder to stay in our shapes.

## what has been changed in recycling compared to the past.

- Intro: popular Korea 
- Body1: materials
- Body2: systematic designated area
- Body3: environment concerns
- Conclusion: 


Around 20 years ago, I was not the kind of person who is related to recycling. However now, I have to recycle various materials as my house chore. What happened in my recycling life? 

Korea is renowned for recycling in the world. As for the U.S, 

First of all, Korean didn't use to be interested in recycling. In the past, we just throw out all garbages including plastics , cans, and food wastes except for empty glass bottles. Because I returned coke bottles to a supermarket to replace them with candies. But now, Since govermnent implemented recycling regulations, the mass public has followed them well. So as a model citizen, I collect recyclable materials into each recycle bin and throw them out.

Second of all, we did't have any area related to recycling in our neiborhoods. However now, we have to throw out recyclables to the designated areas. Korea government has designated recycling areas troughout the country, finally we can collect a lot of recycleable resources in a systematic way.

Lastly, there were garbage disposable areas near Seoul but people had no idea about the limit of them. Since the lack of the disposable area, people were worried about it. They didn't want their neighborhoods to become the new area. From that point on, people have been interested in our environments and recycling. 

In conclusion, we've developed our recycling culture in a systemtic and environmental way. In contract to the other developed coutries, I'm very proud of having such a great recycling culture in my country.
