### You indicated in the survey that you take vacations domestically. Tell me some places you like to travel. Why do you like to go there?

My favorite place in Korea is Jeju Island which is located in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. Many Korean people want to visit Jeju Island because the climate is mild and warm even in the winter season. 

First of all, nature on the island is well maintained and beautiful. There are a lot of forests around the island. You can get relaxed with fresh air if you get into forest. I really like to walk through forests.

Plus you can see the tallest mountain in South Korea, which is called 한라 Mountian. You can see the mountain wherever you are if the weather is find. In the winter season, you can see snow on the top of the mountain.

Also you can travel with less money as there are my options. When you want to rent a car, there are so many rent car companies near Jeju Internaltional airport. Even you can buy tickets cheaper online before you leave. The rent price is quite cheap, maybe it's not over $20 a day with full coverage insurance for sedan for 4 person. With a car, you can go easily wherever you want to go with low cost. I rent mid-size sedan for 5 days the last trip, but I paid only $100s.

As for the foods in the island, you can enjoy various local foods. The pork meat raised on the island is very popular. You can grill it and then have it with soybean paste sauce and fresh vegitables. And also travelers like to visit the retaurants serving a meat noodle and steamed meat. The stock are made of pork borns and meats by boiling them for long hours. The taste is mild and harmonious with noddle. You can put some spicy sauce and chilly into it if you like spicy taste. You have to order  steamed meat if you are meat-like person. it's so tender and juicy, also melt down in your mouth. If you wanna spicy taste and flavour, you'd have it with Kimchi together.


### Let’s say you are preparing to take a trip somewhere. Tell me about all the things that you usually do to get ready.

Well. I'm a person who like to scehdule for everything.

The first thing I shuold do is to buy or reserve tickets for transportation. If I cant' get a ticket, there is no alternatives. 

The second one I usually do is to book a hotel. I think accomodation during a trip is quite important for trip's satisfaction. So, if I have a enough money, I spend much amount of money for a high-quality accomodation, easpecially for a good pool and breakfast.

Final thing to do is to list up the activities such as fishing on the boat or taking a massage. If I have to be hurry up, I can get ticket for those activities cheaper as an early-bird price.

Those things are what I prepare to travel mainly. Thank you for listening.

### Think of a memorable trip you took when you were younger. Where did you go and who did you go with? What did you do or see during that trip?

I can remember the trip to Jeju Island with my whole family a couple of years ago. I went there with my wife and daughter and also with my parents and brother's family. I stayed at the very special resort for two days. It's very expensive resort, so I couldn't go there if I did't get benefits from a company. I guess it's over $1000 for one day.

There was a private building with 2 stories. After I got into the building, all things in the house were luxurious. We bought fresh seafood from local market and cooked and enjoyed the dinner with wine and beer. We had talked much during night and then we can know better each other. I think it is an one of the the most luxuirous trips in my life family together.
