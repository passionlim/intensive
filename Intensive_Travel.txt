1. You indicated in the survey that you take vacations domestically. Tell me some places you like to travel. Why do you like to go there?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My favorite place in Korean is Jeju Island which is localed south of the Korean Peninsula. There are one of the most famous places for Korean because climate is mild and warm even in the winter seaons. 

First of all, nature in the island is well maintained and beautiful. There are a lot of forest around the island. You can get relaxed with fresh air if you get into forest except in the winter season. 

Plus you can see the tallest mountain in South Korea, which is called 한라 Mountian. You can see the mountain wherever you are if the weather is find. in the winter season, you can see the snows on the top of mountain.

And it is good place for travelers in the terms of cost. In the case of rent car. there are so many rent car companies around Jeju Internaltional airport. As you know, compantition make customers happy. The rent price is quite cheap, maybe it's not over $20 a day with full coverage insurance for regular car for 4 person. So you can go easily wherever you want to go in low cost. I rent for whole days in the previous trip.

Overall, there are other reasons why people like that island. there is no enough time to explain.

2. Let’s say you are preparing to take a trip somewhere. Tell me about all the things that you usually do to get ready.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well. I'm a person who like to prepare somehting to be scheduled.

The first thing I shuold do is to buy or reserve a tocket for transportation. if i cant' get a ticket, there is no alternatives. 

the second one I usually do is to booking a hotel. I think accomodation during a trip is quite important for trip's satisfaction. So, If I have a enough money, I spend much amount of money for a high-quality acocomodation. Easpecially for having a good pool and breakfast.

Final doing for a preparation is to list up the activities that I or my travenling party want to do with like fishing on the boat or take a massage.

Those things are what i prepare to travel mainly. Thank you for listening.

3. Think of a memorable trip you took when you were younger. Where did you go and who did you go with? What did you do or see during that
trip?

I can remember the trip to Jeju Island with my whole family a couple of years ago. I have a trip with wife and daughter also with my paretns and brother's family. I stayed at the very special resort I'd never been for two days. It's very expensive resort, so i couldn't go there if I did't get benefits from a company. i guess it's over $1000 for one day.

There was a private building with 2 stories. After I got into the building, all things in the house were luxurious. We bought fresh seafood from local market and cooked and enjoy the dinner with wine and beer. We'd talked much during night. I think it is the most luxuirous trip in my life with whole family togeter.

I guess my parents were busy and they didn't have a chance to visit those kind of place. So I was very happy that whole family could be satisfied.
