[Topic] Pub/Bar

#1 Describe your bars you’ve visited

Let me talk about bars. There are a lot of bars around the station near our office. But I have no favorite bar there because I never make a plan in advance. I only choose the one whenever I need it.

However, there are some bars called beer warehouse I’ve been several times. Like most of bars, the mood is dark and music are played loud. It would not be a good place to talk. 

There are several fridges storing cold beer along a wall. You can look at various type of beer in those fridges. Most of them are in a bottle. As you know, beer in a glass bottle can stay cold for a long time.

That’s all about pub near my office.

#2 What to do in a bar

I’m not quite interested in drinking beer at bars these days, but I sometimes go there to drink beer and to have dinner with colleagues after work.

My favorite place is the closest bar from our office. They sell mainly fried chicken and sweet source fried chicken. Taste of chicken is not special but it's like the taste of chickens we had in our childhood. We spend time by talking about what we’re doing or what troubles we are facing at the office. We have to finish our drinks up before the subway gets cut off.

That’s all about what i do at bars nowadays.  By speding a time at bars, somebody can have hangover, but people at bars stay closer to each other. It can be lubricant among people working together.

The most memorable event I've experience at bars happend serveral month ago. I usually work from 10 to 7. I didn't expect to go to bars before some problem occured in the systems of my company. 

It was a usual day before the problem came up. We faced the trouble from 3 to 10. we are totally exhasuted when we complete to solve the prolbemns. It was late at night. we need kind of stress reliver and food before finishing our day. So we headed to the bar together. 

We were also exhausted at work, but needed something for our mental recovery. We decided to go to bars to have dinner or snacks with beer. We could get relaxed and soften our tensions down. We cheered up our effort what we did. We were all proud of ourselves. 

After that, we can be more confident at work, and spending a time at bars at that time help us be hard as one team.

I had a event at the bar where i mentioned in the previous answer.
