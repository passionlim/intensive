## Tokyo or Shanghai

Tokyo is the one of the biggest cities in Japan. I’ve never been there. But I’ve read and heard some news in Tokyo from my friends.

As you know, there was a disaster of an earthquake in early 2010s. The Nuclear Power Plan in Fukushima was destroyed by high tides, then the situation was getting worse than the news we faced. The Government tried to conceal the true fact about the disaster, so people especially in Tokyo near Fukushima were concerned with their safety. Some people moved to further cities in southern island of Japan. I knew some people working in Tokyo at that time, they really wanted to leave the city as soon as possible, especially the ones living with a family together hurried up. Most people thought Tokyo and Japan finished and no one wanted to live.

However as the time goes by, people’s thinking has been changed. The industry and economic has been recovered well then people are starting to visit there again. Foreign workers can get a job in Tokyo easier than before. 

I guess it’s true that people would forget easily. You know, there is a quote . “The mass is fool.” I have a plan for a trip to Japan on this December, I’m fool, too.

## Mon Jae In or Park Geunhye
The former President

She is a former President who had ruled until 2015. She’s a daughter of strongman who was former President for 1960s-1970s. Most of young people I met doesn’t like her because of her wrong decision. 

She was impeached in 2015 when people in Korea had demonstrated for several months.

She rose the power by controlling public medias to keep their power strong. Then she didn’t respond to people’s voice. Since she conquered the media, it had made people upset(=infuried). People standing on opposite side tried to changed political situations prevent the media from being controlled. It

Some people insist that she’s commtted in election fraud in 2012, but there is not clear evidence for that. And also 

After impeachment, various evidencies unveiling those rumors come out consequently.
