### You indicated in the survey that you take vacations at home. When you stay home during the vacation, what do you normally do? And who do you normally meet ?

Well, I'm married with a little daughter. I try to spend the most of time with her when I stay at home. You know, most working moms are tired for caring for their children on the weekdays. So parenting usually is a male's duty during a vacation at home.

My daughter likes to ride a bike in the town these days, so I usually go outside with her and watch her to ride safe. Sometimes she fall down on the bike, and then I take care of the wound if she get hurt or just shake a dust off her clothes. 

Actually, I like to stay indoor rather than outside. I like to spend a time with smart phone without thoughts like taking a meditation. When my daughter do something else like watching TV shows or animations, I can really do it. I sit on the cough in the living room, and take a foot massage with the machine that I bought few weeks ago. It's really relaxing without any concerns.

That's all about thing I do at home.

### What did you do on your first day to the last day of your last vacation? Tell me everything about the things you did on your last vacation at home.

There were long holydays last October this year. I had 9 days off. I had no idea to go somewhere. I just visited to the parents' house for 3 days. I spend most of days at home. 

The one of favorite things during those days was a bike-riding picnic with all family together. My daugher is 6yrs, she just learned how to ride a bike by herself. And she also want to ride further away. So we decided to go to the riverside park toghter. The park is 4km away from home. It's not quite far distance for me, but it was a challengable distance for my daughter.

we packed some snacks and a couple of water bottles into backpack. We left home, then after 30 minutes we stopped by the fastfood restaurent for lunch. The taste was good. It might be good because of excercise. After 30 minutes, finally we just arrived to the destination. We took a rest for a while by throwing stones into the river and making stone houses in the sand. and then we came back home. We all got tired and slept deeaply at that night.

### Tell me about unusual or unexpected experience you had  during the vacation that you spent at home. What happened and why was it so memorable?

The same answer above.
