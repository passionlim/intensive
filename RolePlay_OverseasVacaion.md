# [RolePlay] Hotel 

## You are staying at a hotel room overseas and you need to book a room. Call the front desk and ask some questions regarding your hotel stay.


Good morning, I plan to visit your hotel, but I have some questions before making a reservation.

I’ll arrive at your hotel late at night? I’m afraid I cannot check in the room that I’d reserve. Would you explain what I should do for late-checkin? Is there any disadvantage for late-checkin?

<Sir, just let us know what time you’ll arrive at the hotel >

Yeah... And I’ll be accompanied by 3 members of my family. We might get there on an empty stomach. One of us is my 6 years old daughter. I’d like to look for restaurants that serves foods for a child. Are there any restaurants nearby open at around 9pm?

<Yeah, the Japanese restaurant on 1st floor will open until 11pm. ... >

I’d like to purchase some beer to enjoy at night. Because of my little daughter, it’s hard to leave my room at night. Would you like to tell me about the place where I can purchase beer nearby at night?

<Yeah, there are small convenience store within walking distance near our hotel. You can buy snacks and beer.  >

Your kind explanation make me happy. Thank you for your kindness.

## I'm going to give you a situation to act out Pretend that you are overseas on vacation and you need a car to get around, so you have gone to a car rental agency. Ask the agent three or four questions about renting a car.

Good morning. I’d like to rent a car, but I have some questions beforehand. 

We are 4 members of my family. I’m looking for a suitible vehicle for my family. In addition I brought a couple of luggages. And also I‘d be satisfied if the car is relatively reliable and its rental cost including general insurance is under $100 per a day. Would you like to recommend some vehicles? 

< I strongly recommend you A.... >

Thank you for your recommendation. I’d like to choose this Toyota’s with full coverage insurance for 5 days. By the way, I’m accompanied by 6 yrs old kid. Do you offer child seats free of charge[at no additional cost]? Or Do I need to pay an additional cost for a seat?

< Nope.. It’s free >

Ok, I’m happy to hear that. Actually this is my first time to this country. I'm wondering if GPS is installed in the car. Does the car have it?

< Yap, It is installed. >

Yea, I feel better. Thank you for your kindness.
I’ll pay for a total cost with my visa.
