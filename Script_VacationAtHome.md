### You indicated in the survey that you take vacations at home. When you stay home during the vacation, what do you normally do? And who do you normally meet ?

Well, I'm married to my wife and we have a little daughter. I try to spend the most of my time with her when I stay at home. You know, most working moms are exhausted after caring for their children on weekdays. Parenting during vacation usually is men's duty. 

My daughter likes to ride a bicycle in my town these days, so I usually go outside with her and watch her ride safely. Sometimes she falls down on the bicycle, but I just shake off the dust on her clothes. 

Actually, I like to stay indoors rather than outdoors. I like to spend time with my smart phone siting on the couch in the livingroom. And also I bought a foot massage machine a few weeks ago. Getting a foot massage is my favorite activity at home. In my opinion, I'm pretty sure that staying relaxed during holidays is like putting fuel into my mind and my body.

### What did you do on your first day to the last day of your last vacation? Tell me everything about the things you did on your last vacation at home.

There was a long holiday this year. I had 9 days off. I had no specific plan to go anywhere. I just visited the parents' houses for 3 days. I stayed most of days at home. First, I watched a couple of movies during the holiday. The most memorable movie was the Mission Impossible 5, starring Tom cruise. My wife and I enjoyed the movie becasue there were no time to watch movie on weekdays.

At second, we had a memorable bicycle trip with my daugher. It was the first bicycle trip family together. It was challenging and tough for our dauther. But she sucessfully completed it without any complaint. My wife and I were so happy to see her grow up well.

### Tell me about unusual or unexpected experience you had  during the vacation that you spent at home. What happened and why was it so memorable?

There is no unexpected experience that I can recall so far. But I can take a bicycle trip with my family as a memorable event on last Korean Thankgiving holiday. We had 9 days off during the holiday.

My daughter is 6yrs. But staying at home for an entire day was not easy for her. she was bored and really wanted to go outside. We decided to go on a bicycle trip all family together. The destiation was the riverside park 4 killometers away. It was not quite far for me, but it was a challenging distance for my daughter.

We packed some snacks and a couple of water bottles into our backpack, then we left home. After 30 minutes we stopped by the fastfood restaurent for lunch. The taste was good because of workout. After 30 minutes, finally we just arrived at the destination. We took a rest for a while by throwing stones into the river and making stone houses in the sand. and then we came back home. 

After the trip, my wife and I were so proud of our daughter. It's because the trip might be a tough experience for her, but she had never complaint to us. Even she looked exited. We hope our daughter will overcome difficulties in her future like this trip.
