I’m living with my wife. we haven’t decide yet who takes which responsibility. 

During last weekend, I was playing computer games, and watching videos in the living room after lunch. But my wife suddenly yelled out. At that time I had not realized what made her so angry. My wife was upset because I did’t support her with house chores. I know she was trying to do all house chores such as  washing dishes, doing laundry and folding clothes by herself. However, how could I know her demands in her mind without saying?

After that, I stood up, and went out to throw out food waste and to do recycling.  Although Its smelled of waste, I felt sorry for her because I didn’t realize how hard it was. It eventually made my wife work off her anger.
