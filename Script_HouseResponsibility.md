# [Topic] House Responsibility

## You indicated that you are responsible for doing household chores. Tell me about the lastest household chore that you have done recently. Describe memorable experience of doing household chores.

I’m living with my wife. we haven’t decide yet who takes which responsibility. 

During last weekend, I was playing computer games, and watching videos in the living room after lunch. But my wife suddenly yelled out. At that time I had not realized what made her so angry. My wife was upset because I did’t support her with house chores. I know she was trying to do all house chores such as  washing dishes, doing laundry and folding clothes by herself. However, how could I know her demands in her mind without saying?

After that, I stood up, and went out to throw out food waste and to do recycling.  Although Its smelled of waste, I felt sorry for her because I didn’t realize how hard it was. It eventually made my wife work off her anger.
