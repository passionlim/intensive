[Wrapup] Nov. 27th

<Morning Session>
좀 생각해 볼께요. 시간 좀 주세요.  
  Let me think about it, give me 

그러고 보니, 그렇게 말하니.  
 Now that you mentioned

주제를 좀 벗어났네요.
 I’ve moved off the topic.

큰 기대를 하고 있었죠. 
 I had huge expectations.

그 때가 참 좋았는데 말이죠.
 Ah, I reminisce good all days.

~지도 참 오래됐네요.
 **It’s been a long time since** I attended the concert 

그 상황을 해결해야 했다.
 I had to handle the situation.  
 I had to take care of the situation. 

~에서 ~분 거리에 위치하고 있다
My house is located 50 minutes away from my office.

더이상 참을 수 없었어요. 
 I couldn’t stand it any longer.  
 I couldn’t take it any longer.

예전보다 더 나아요.
 It’s much better than before

아. 잊어 먹을 뻔 했군요
 Ah. I almost forgot about it.

안타깝게도
 Unfortunately

<Scripts using above expressions at least>
**Let me think about it**. I got into the computer games before my marriage. **I had huge expectations** for playing with my wife. Unfortunately, since my marriage, my wife has been mat at me whenever I played computer games. I couldn’t stand it any longer. We didn’t take to each other for a couple of days. It’s been a long time since I played computer games without my wife’s permission. Ah, I reminisce the good of all days(?).

<Da>
I got a number and waited on line.
Because i can only make my time at lunch but I don’t have much time left**.
I’ll go to the branch where you explained it to me and I have **apply for** a new card

<Jen>
I ~~put~~ **inserted** the wrong credit card into the machine by accident, so ATM ate my card. I felt like the end of the world because bank service centers were not supposed to be on duty on holidays.

So I called the emergency center and requested **for him** to come and check the machine. It felt like ~~ an age~~ **ages(=forever)** waiting for him ~~coming~~. 

I really want to complain about how long I’d waited outside in front of the ATM machine.

But still, I let out a sigh of relief.

**Sad to say**, one day her little creature passed away without any reason.
말하긴 슬프지만
