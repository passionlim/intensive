## Summer vacation on a beach ( revised)

- Intro : general description on a beach in the summer
- Body1 : Tom’s story - perfectionist
- Body2 : Jack’s story - spontaneous traveler
- Conc : individual way for a vacation. Don’t judge

It was a beautiful day on ~~a~~ **the** beach where people ~~wilded~~ **wound** down and felt a breeze from the ocean. The beach wasn’t crow**d**ed with travelers yet because a couple of weeks were still left until the peak season. There were two men on the beach who were on their vacation: Tom, Jack.

Tom is a perfectionist. He can be comfortable **only if** everything is ready. So for this summer vacation, he prepared all needed items from beginning to end such as a parasol, a beach chair and **a paif of** sunglasses. He also brought a book that he wanted to read. He ~~stood~~ **set** the parasol and unfolded the chair. By staring at the ocean, he was able to get ~~relaxed~~ away from his daily grind.

In contrast to Tom, Jack has never prepared **for** his trip in advance. He **spontaneously** likes to go on **trips** ~~spontaneously~~. For this vacation, he just left for the ocean without a plan. After driving for several hours, he stopped by the beach to take a rest. He took a deep breath and absorbed peaceful atmosphere. He just ~~sit~~ **sat** on the beach next to Tom, and began to talk to him. ~~As for Jack's stress reliever, talking to someone~~ **To talk to someone** is the best way **for Jack to relieve his stress**.

In conclusion, like this story, people have their own ways to spend their vacation and to relieve their stress. Therefore we cannot judge which way is better. 


### comments for mistakes 

1. It was a beautiful day on **the** beach where people **wound** down and felt a breeze from the ocean.

- I should use "the" in front of "beach" instead of "a" because I'm describing the specific beach. 
- I misunderstood a past tense of "wind". It should be "wound". and I should be also cautious to pronounce it because there is the same spelled word whose pronounse is different.

2. He can be comfortable **only if** everything is ready.
- The phrase "only if" is very useful to describe a cause and an effect between two sentences which are repectively connected to it. the fact of the former sentense is necessary condition for the fact of the latter. 

3. such as a parasol, a beach chair and **a paif of** sunglasses.
- Forms of words following "such as" should match to each other. All words besides "sunglasses" are singular. So I have to insert "a pair of" in front of it.
