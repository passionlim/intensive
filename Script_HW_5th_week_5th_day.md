## Summer vacation on a beach ( revised)

- Intro : general description on a beach in the summer
- Body1 : Tom’s story - perfectionist
- Body2 : Jack’s story - spontaneous traveler
- Conc : individual way for a vacation. Don’t judge

It was a beautiful day on **the** beach where people ~~wilded~~ **wound** down and felt a breeze from the ocean. The beach wasn’t crow**d**ed with travelers yet because a couple of weeks were still left until the peak season. There were two men on the beach who were on their vacation: Tom, Jack.

Tom is a perfectionist. He can be comfortable **only if** everything is ready. So for this summer vacation, he prepared all needed items from beginning to end such as a parasol, a beach chair and **a paif of** sunglasses. He also brought a book that he wanted to read. He ~~stood~~ **set** the parasol and unfolded the chair. By staring at the ocean, he was able to get ~~relaxed~~ away from his daily grind.

In contrast to Tom, Jack has never prepared **for** his trip in advance. He **spontaneously** likes to go on **trips** ~~spontaneously~~. For this vacation, he just left for the ocean without a plan. After driving for several hours, he stopped by the beach to take a rest. He took a deep breath and absorbed peaceful atmosphere. He just ~~sit~~ **sat** on the beach next to Tom, and began to talk to him. ~~As for Jack's stress reliever, talking to someone~~ **To talk to someone** is the best way **for Jack to relieve his stress**.

In conclusion, like this story, people have their own ways to spend their vacation and to relieve their stress. Therefore we cannot judge which way is better.
