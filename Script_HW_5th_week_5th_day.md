## Summer vacation on a beach ( revised)

- Intro : general description on a beach in the summer
- Body1 : Tom’s story - perfectionist
- Body2 : Jack’s story - spontaneous traveler
- Conc : individual way for a vacation. Don’t judge

It was a beautiful day on ~~a~~ **the** beach where people ~~wilded~~ **wound** down and felt a breeze from the ocean. The beach wasn’t crow**d**ed with travelers yet because a couple of weeks were still left until the peak season. There were two men on the beach who were on their vacation: Tom, Jack.

Tom is a perfectionist. He can be comfortable **only if** everything is ready. So for this summer vacation, he prepared all needed items from beginning to end such as a parasol, a beach chair and **a paif of** sunglasses. He also brought a book that he wanted to read. He ~~stood~~ **set** the parasol and unfolded the chair. By staring at the ocean, he was able to get ~~relaxed~~ away from his daily grind.

In contrast to Tom, Jack has never prepared **for** his trip in advance. He **spontaneously** likes to go on **trips** ~~spontaneously~~. For this vacation, he just left for the ocean without a plan. After driving for several hours, he stopped by the beach to take a rest. He took a deep breath ~~of~~ **and absorbed** peaceful atmosphere. He just ~~sit~~ **sat** on the beach next to Tom, and began to talk to him because ~~As for Jack's stress reliever, talking to someone~~ **To talk to someone** is the best way **for Jack to relieve his stress**.

In conclusion, like this story, people have their own ways to spend their vacation and to relieve their stress. Therefore we cannot judge which way is better. 


### comments for mistakes 

1. It was a beautiful day on **the** beach where people **wound** down and felt a breeze from the ocean.

- I should use "the" in front of "beach" instead of "a" because I'm describing the specific beach. 
- I misunderstood a past tense of "wind". It should be "wound". and I should be also cautious to pronounce it because there is the same spelled word whose pronounse is different.

2. He can be comfortable <Condition Q> **only if** everything is ready <Condition P>.
- The phrase "only if" is very useful to describe a cause and an effect between two sentences which are repectively connected to it. 
- the former is necessary for the latter. the latter is sufficent for the former.
- this sentense is equivalent to "**If** he can be comfortable <P>, everything is ready. <Q>"
- According to propositional logic, this sentence is equivalent to "If everything is not ready, he cannot be comfortable"

3. such as a parasol, a beach chair and **a paif of** sunglasses.
- Forms of words following "such as" should match to each other. All words besides "sunglasses" are singular. So I have to insert "a pair of" in front of it.

4. He **set** the parsol.
- the verb "stood" is not natural for a parasol. so I should use another word "set" instead of it. 
- But I can use the verb "stand up" with "a utility pole(전봇대)." For an exmaple, they stand up utility poles to supply electricity to the town.
- The verb that I mentioned, "erect", is suitable for big objects such as building.

5. he was able to get ~~relaxed~~ away from his daily grind.
- I wrote down this sentence to express not only getting relaxed from work but also getting away from his daily grid. However by including the both, the meaning of the sentence slightly became unnatural for readers. So I erase the word "relaxed" from the sentence for readers to understand it clearly.

6. Jack has never prepared **for** his trip in advance.
- The verb "prepare" can have specific items as its object. If I want to describe a preparation for general things, I have to put them after the proposition "for".

7. He **spontaneously** likes to go on **trips** ~~spontaneously~~.
- The adverb "spontaneously" can take a place in front of verbs or in the end of sentences. Both are possible.
- When I mention general trips, I should use a plural word.

8. He took a deep breath ~~of~~ **and absorbed** peaceful atmosphere.
- The expression "a breath of peaceful atmosphere" is unnatural and abstract to understand. So I have to seperate it and find a suitible verb for the word "atmosphere."

9. He just ~~sit~~ **sat** on the beach next to Tom,
- I misunderstood a past tence of the verb "sit". So I have to change "sit" to "sat". 

10. **To talk** to someone is the best way **for Jack to relieve the stress.**
- The entire sentence was not nartral to explain Jack's stress reliver.
- And also I changed "talking" to "To talk" in the subject of the sentence to make it more natural.
- Besides "As for" phrase, I put some phrases in the end of the sentence to describe "the best way."

## The essay about week 5 and/or week 6 
(past tense, present perfect tense, past continuous, present progressive, and future tenses may be used)  
(I recommend you include your personal goal!)

- Intro: my first impression for intensive course
- Body1: difficulties during a first couple of weeks. 
- Body2: looking for solutions. kept my condition. 
- Body3: solutions by my classmates and instructor.
- Concl: Hard works pays off

I was selected as a participant in the 3rd intensive language program of this year of my company. In the beginning, I was concerned about how well I could follow the program. But I had always suffered from insufficient proficiency in English when it was needed. I thought it would be a good chance to improve my English. 

In the beginning, I thought I was confident to speak English in any situation because I archived the opic score that I was supposed to get. However, as time passeed, It had been too hard for me to understand all I learend in the class and also to complete homework every day. I made a lot of grammartic mistakes and wrote unnatural sentences in my essay. In addition the hardest part during those days was to make a well-organized story for given questions and to give a speech about it. I was utterly poor at everything and it made me depressed. The only thing that I was able to do was to spend time for my study as long as possible. 

Since the second week, despite my effort, I became totally exhausted after studying every day. I realized that studying late at night was inefficeint for me to concentrate on the class on the following day. I stopped staying in classroom late at night and started working out after dinner. It really helped me to keep my condition. 

Fortunately, I got some advice from my classmates and my instructor for the concern about the improvement. Regarding the advice, I should simplify the expression and the flow in the essay according to my uncovered ability. Then I assumed myself to become an elemetray school student. It began helping me to advance a bit. Since around 4th week, I had noticed my improvement in my essays. They became more pursuasive and well-organized compared to my previous ones.

And now just a week is left to the end. I have archived improvement a bit for giving a speech and writing essays. Furthuremore I can again feel as confident as I did before this retreat. Finally I'm making it a point to come up to the scratch for my English study journey. It goes without saying that hard works pays off. I appreciate my encouraging classmates, my enthusiatic instructor and all staffs to support us.
