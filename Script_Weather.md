- Intro : four distinct seasons, distinct leitures

- Conclusion my favorite - fall

Korea has a temperate climate, which means there are four distinct seasons. So leisure activities people prefer is diverse according to seasons.

In the spring and fall, weathers are usually mild and calm. We can enjoy going on a picnic and jogging in parks. In the fall, after the temperature starts to fall, we can enjoy seeing beautiful scenery of colorful leaves in maintains.

However, In the summer and the winter, itâ€™s too hot and too cold for people to hang out at parks. However, water parks and ski resorts always are crowed during those seasons.

To sum it up, although I can enjoy various activities for that each season, I normally prefer going to mountains to see beautiful view in the fall.

### Do you think that the weather has changed over the past few years? What was it like in the past? How has it changed? Please describe the differences in detail.

Since global warming has had an effect on weather changes globally, the climate of Korea cannot avoid its effect.
                           
Since recent several years, there have been the news reporting climate changes in South Korea. The news mentioned that winters and summers are longer and longer and springs and falls are shorter and shorter as time goes by. It means that Korea is having similar climates with warmer countries. 

After the long-lasting winter, we have been frequently facing lack of water in the spring for recent few years. Most places  where water is stored  has been dried up. Some farmers are facing troubles to raise their crops

In conclusion, the change in weather affects out lives in an negative way. However as human beings have been adaptive for their environments, we will find a way to solve.
