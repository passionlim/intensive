## situation that cannot make it to the movies

Google : Hey, Young. I’m afraid that I have some bad news.
   Remember our appointment to the movie tomorrow? 
   But I caught the flu, and I have a vicious headache and a high fever.
   So it’s hard to make it to the movies.

Young: That’s too bad.

Google: Why don’t we reschedule our appointment after my recovery?
   Or How about going with Jeniffer??
    I’m totally impossible to get out today.

Young: Ok I’ll check the Jen’s schedule.

Google: 

I’m so sorry for the cancelation.
I’ll try make it up to you after recovery. OK?
Thanks a lot. Have fun, guys.
