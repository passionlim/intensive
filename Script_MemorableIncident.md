# Memorable Incident

## describe memorable incident when you were at the ( theater, cafe, pub )

Well, I had a meeting with my colleages at the cafe on the basement of my company building serveral weeks ago. We just had a chat together, and suddenly I got notifications about troubles on our website. The notifications means that our customer couldn't buy products on our website. As I introduced at previous question, I'm in charge of managing and running web site of my company. We sell various kinds of products on our website. If our website are in trouble, it would make huge influences on our company's profits.

I was very frustrated at that time. so I had to run out the cafe as soon as possible. I was not sure how serious the problems were. When I got into the office, some of colleagues had been handling the problems. The cause of problems was the unexpected traffic by a new event. We adjusted some settings in our system to handle the situation. After our website was recovered to the normal situation, I could be relieved definitely.
