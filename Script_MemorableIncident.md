# Memorable Incident

## describe a memorable incident when you stayed at the ( theater / cafe / pub )

Well, I had a meeting with my colleages at the cafe on the basement of my company building serveral weeks ago. We just had a chat together, and suddenly I got notifications about troubles on our website. The notifications meant that our customer couldn't buy products on our website. If our website are in trouble, it would make huge influences on our company's profits.

Because I'm in charge of managing and running web site of my company, I was very frustrated at that time. so I had to run out the cafe as soon as possible. I was not sure how serious the problems were. When I got into the office, some of colleagues had been handling the problems. The cause of problems was the unexpected traffic from a new event. We adjusted some settings in our system to handle the situation. It worked!! After our website was recovered to the normal situation, I could be relieved definitely.
