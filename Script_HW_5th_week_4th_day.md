- Conc : individual way for a vacation. Don’t judge

It was a beautiful day on a beach where people wilded down and felt a breeze from the ocean. The beach wasn’t crowed with travelers yet because a couple of weeks were still left until the peak season. There were two men on the beach who were on their vacation: Tom, Jack.

Tom is a perfectionist. He can be comfortable only if everything is ready. So for this summer vacation, he prepared all needed items from beginning to end such as a parasol, a beach chair and sunglasses. He also brought a book that he wanted to read. He stood the parasol and unfolded the chair. By staring at the ocean, he was able to get relaxed away from his daily grind.

In contrast to Tom, Jack has never prepared his trip in advance. He likes to go on a trip spontaneously. For this vacation, he just left for the ocean without a plan. After driving for several hours, he stopped by the beach to take a rest. He took a deep breath of peaceful atmosphere. He just sit on the beach next to Tom, and began to talk to him. As for Jack’s stress reliver, talking to someone is the best way.

In conclusion, like this story, people have their own ways to spend their vacation and to relieve their stress. Therefore we cannot judge which way is better.
