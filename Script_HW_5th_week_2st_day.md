I tried to pull myself together, but I was embarrassed in my mind. To solve the problem, I found the location of the Korea embassy and I went there to explain my situation. They requested my ID on which my photo was attached and documents which identified myself such as my flight ticket. I gave them everything they wanted and fortunately they promised to issue the replacement  passport before I got on the plane.

I learned from this experience that I should be careful. And now when I go on a trip, I avoid crowded places and double-check my belongings. 

## describe the process of recycling 

There are many house chores in my house. Among them, throwing out garbages and recycling is the most common house chore for men. I’m also responsible for recycling. Even though there is no regular day for recycling, I usually throw out them on weekends. 

First of all, I collect recyclable materials in the laundary room. There are 3 recycling bins where I put each material respectively. I divide the bins for 3 purposes: paper, plastic, and the rest. Separated recycling bins help me to reduce time to finish my house chore.  

On weekends, I bring those bins to the designated area beside my apartment. There are big bags for each material. I pour each recycling bin into the respective big bag. Sometimes I get my hands dirty with leaking drinks or remaining foods while picking up materials. Then, I return back home and wash my hands.

Conclusion,  even though the recycling is tedious and disgusting for me, I have to do recycling because if I did’t, I would get fined by the government.
