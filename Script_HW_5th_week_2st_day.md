I tried to pull myself together, but I was embarrassed in my mind. To solve the problem, I found the location of the Korea embassy and I went there to explain my situation. They requested my ID on which my photo was attached and documents which was able to identify myself, such as my flight ticket. I gave them everything they wanted and fortunately they promised to issue the replacement passport before I got on the plane.

I learned from this experience that I should be careful. And now when I go on a trip, I avoid crowded places and double-check my belongings. 

## describe the process of recycling 

There are many house chores in my house. Among them, I’m responsible for recycling. Even though there is no regular day for recycling, I usually throw them out on weekends. 

First of all, I collect recyclable materials in the laundary room. There are 3 recycling bins where I put each material. I divide the bins for 3 categories: paper, plastic, and the rest. By separating the bins, I can reduce my time to get recycling done.

On weekends, I bring those bins to the designated area beside my apartment. There are big bags for each material. I pour each recycling bin into its respective bags. Sometimes I get my hands dirty with leaking drink from cans or remaining food on packages while picking them up. Then, I return back home and wash my hands.

Conclusion, even though recycling is tedious and disgusting for me, I have to recycle because if I don’t so, I would get fined by our government that has implemented strong regularations for recycling.
